## WHY SHOULD WE USE THEM?
- Remove **confusion** over many life cycle methods
- Allowing you to separate large components into various **smaller functions**, rather than having to force all your stateful logic into a single component.
- No fundamental changes to your react knowledge, it is more direct way to use features you already know after all it is just a functions.
- **Fewer** lines of code 
- No need to use \'*this*\' keyword 
- Easy to test with \"*react-dom//test-utils*\"
